* Codename: Paulownia
[[https://travis-ci.org/stumpwm/paulownia][https://travis-ci.org/stumpwm/paulownia.svg?branch=master]]

StumpWM's codebase while stable is showing its age.  Furthermore there
have been recent developments in the common lisp ecosystem that
stumpwm has been insulated from.  

This is an attempt to modernize the stumpwm codebase while fixing some
of stumpwm's Achilles heels. 
** Design Goals
(From achievable to lofty)
- Test driven design. Unit tests that matter
- Re-use as much code from stumpwm as possible, don't reinvent the
  wheel unless its broken
- Support for non-ascii input
- Utilize existing libraries rather than re-implementing subsets of
  existing functionality
- Tighter emacs integration
- Support for multiple backends (wayland, mir, X11)
** Technology
- [[roswell]] for building/deploying
- [[https://github.com/fukamachi/prove][prove]] for unit testing
- travis-ci for cloud CI testing
- [[https://shinmera.github.io/qtools/][qtools]] for gui components
- various packages carved out of the stumpwm codebase and re-packaged
  for quicklisp distribution
* Why Paulownia?
It seems like a strange name, stumpwm reminds me of a tree stump, the
idea behind this is to burn stumpwm to the ground and grow it back up
stronger and better than before.  If you google [[https://www.google.com/search?q=phoenix%2Btree][phoenix tree]], the top
hit is the wiki page describing the genus Paulownia. The wiki page
actually draws a lot of analogies to the goals of this project, so the
name was chosen.
